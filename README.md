## Components
Button: Represents each button on the calculator. The button can be a digit, an operator, or a control button (e.g., C for clear).
Display: Displays the current input or the result of the calculation.
Calculator: Main component that ties everything together. It handles the state, manages the logic for operations, and renders the buttons and display.
